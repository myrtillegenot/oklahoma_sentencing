# In Whose Interest : Private Prisons and Sentencing Lengths 

#### Capstone Project by Myrtille Génot, as part of the Ms in Applied Economics at the University of San Francisco. 

###### Motivation

Profit and prisons have a long history. Although the13th Amendment **abolished involutary servitutude**, a loophole exempted prisoners from this protection. 

This led to a quick expansion of prison populations, especially in the South, and especially of African-Americans.

Following conviction, most prisoners were sent to prison camps and **leased to private companies as cheap labour**. This was a violent system that led to widespread abuse and death. States disallowed private convict leasing in the 1920s due to complaints of unfair competition from businesses that paid market rates for their labour, and the polemical death of a young Caucasian man, **Martin Talbert**.

**Martin Talbert**, arrested in 1922 for riding a train without a ticket and failing to pay the subsequent 25$ fine, was leased to Putnam Lumber Yard in Dixie County Florida where he was **flogged to death** by prison guard Thomas Higginbotham.

**Talbert’s $25 fine had actually been paid** by his family, which had rushed the money upon hearing of his arrest. However, it was widely known that **Sheriff J R Jones touched a ‘$20 head fee for each able bodied man he turned to the lumber company.’** Had he processed the fine, he would have lost Talbert’s head fee.



Disbanding prison camps was difficult as they were protected by the wealthy and well connected. For example, **Knabb Turpentine** in nearby Baker county, described by a contemporary prison supervisor as a **"human slaughter pen"** was owned by **State Senator Knabb** (fourth to the left below).

##### This points to a clear issue. When there is a financial gain to be made from incarcerating people, sub-optimal outcomes occur from resulting distortions in the justice system. 

##### *So why are profits back in the prison system?*

Well, just because **convict leasing had been outlawed for private companies, prison labour itself didn't stop**. In fact, many states continued to use their inmate populations as a form of cheap labour for themselves. Notably, Southern states re-purposed former plantation land to 'prison farms', some of which are still in existence today.  

Prison farms broached the path to modern prison privatisation through one man : **T. Don Hutto**. 

T. Don Hutto had worked as a warden at the Ramsey Prison Farm for African-Americans in Southeastern Texas. Hutto had a 'knack' for running prisons, and for running them cheap. In fact, he was so successful he eventually became the director of Corrections for the state of Arkansas, and then Virginia. In 1983, along with two other co-founders, he created the first private prison company : Corrections Corporation of America (since rebranded as CoreCivic, following several lawsuits.)

##### I want to know : does the introduction of private prisons lead to distortions in the justice system? Specifically, does the use of state-level private prisons have an effect on sentencing lengths?
